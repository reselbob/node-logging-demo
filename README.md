#Node Logging Demo
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate different ways to log Javascript objects using the [Logentries NodeJS Agent](https://logentries.com/doc/nodejs/).

##Installation

`npm install`

`node ./bin/www`

##PS
This basis of this code is an autogenerated Express application. Thus, there is a lot of code present that is not necessary.

You'll find the interesting demonstration code in `./bin/wwww`, `./routes/index.js` and `./lib/logging-utils/js`.
